# Financial AI Agent Using Phidata
This project leverages Agentic AI to create an intelligent system that can answer financial questions by integrating multiple agents. It uses PhiData's playground to provide a web-based interface where users can query financial information. The system combines a Web Search Agent and a Finance AI Agent that can access data from sources like DuckDuckGo (for web searches) and Yahoo Finance (for financial market data).

## Agentic AI
Agentic AI refers to AI systems that are designed to act autonomously and intelligently to carry out specific tasks or solve problems. These agents are often embedded with specialized tools and can interact with external data sources to provide insights and answers. In this project, Agentic AI is implemented by creating two agents: one for searching the web and another for accessing financial data.

## PhiData
PhiData is an advanced platform that provides powerful tools and models to facilitate the creation and deployment of AI agents. It allows the integration of various models and APIs to enhance the decision-making abilities of AI agents. Using PhiData, developers can easily create intelligent systems that can interact with multiple data sources and tools.

The **PhiData Playground** is an interface that allows developers and users to interact with the AI agents they’ve built. In this project, the Playground provides a web-based platform to ask financial questions and receive answers generated by the combined efforts of the Web Search Agent and Finance AI Agent.

## Requirements

To run this project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7+
- [phidata]([https://github.com/phi-agent/phi](https://docs.phidata.com/introduction))
- `yfinance` library
- `duckduckgo` library
- `python-dotenv` for environment variable management

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-information-assistant.git
cd financial-information-assistant
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following keys:
```
PHI_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```
Replace your_pinecone_api_key, your_gemini_api_key, and your_llama_api_key with the appropriate keys.
4. Run the application:
In the project directory, run the following command to start the application:
```
python financial-agent.py
```
You should see the following output in the terminal:
```

## Using PhiData Playground
1. Open the PhiData Playground: https://www.phidata.app/playground/chat
2. Set the endpoint:
In the Endpoint field, enter the endpoint shown in your terminal output. For example: `localhost:7777`.

3. Ask financial questions:
Once the endpoint is set, you can interact with the system by asking financial queries, such as:

- "What is the current stock price of Tesla?"
- "Show me the latest news about Nvidia."
- "Give me the stock fundamentals for Microsoft."
The agents will retrieve the data and present it in a clear, structured format, including sources.
